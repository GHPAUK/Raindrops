# Raindrops

## Pling, Plang or Plong?

A question I am often asked; do raindrops containing the factors of three, five, seven or a mixture of each sound like pling, plang or plong when they land? 

I offer a simple solution to this question. written in a test driven development manner.

## Reflections
My initial thoughts on the overall problem and it's solution were positive. 
I knew exactly what I wanted to do to implement a satisfactory final solution. 
Utilising a TDD practice, writing the tests 
before implementing the functionality, helped me remain clear 
with what was to be done next in order to satisfy the requirements.

I have included mutation tests in order to offer more security across the project's coverage as a whole.
If the tests do not fail when changed, it could be an indication that an issue exists within the code or test itself.
